Deliberate Practice
    This seems like very good advice. I'm always torn when I program without a given assignment, because I don't know what to focus on. Usually I grab a project from somewhere and work on it, but I wonder if that is the best use of my time. Maybe in the future I'll try to find a small, finisheable challenge like Rosalind.

Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset
    Winston Churchill once said "Success consists of going from one failure to another without loss of enthusiasm." I've really taken that to heart in my life and embraced all of my failures as learning experiences, and I try not to make the same mistake twice. I think this outlook has a lot of similarities to that approach and I'm very receptive to "not yet."

Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit
    Another favorite quote of mine is from Mark Danielewski who said "Passion has little to do with euphoria and everything to do with patience. It is not about feeling good. It is about endurance. Like patience, passion comes from the same Latin root: pati. It does not mean to flow with exuberance. It means to suffer." Grit seems to line up nicely with that concept, where true growth comes from enduring difficulties with dignity rather than harnessing an enthusiasm for the subject.

Alain de Botton on Redefining Success
    My biggest takeaway from this is that we can't be succesful at everything. Everything requires a sacrifice and "losing" at something else. I have a lot of difficulty coping with this truism
    because I don't like the idea of missing out on anything. 

Drs. Sarah on Imposter Syndrome
    Everyone thinks this is about them, right? Because I struggle with this so much, even though I think I'm never below the middle of the class on anything. Based on their experiences it sounds like this will just go away with time, or at least I'll become an imposter at higher levels of skill as I justify my growth and development.
